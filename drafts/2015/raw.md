# Raw

# The appraisal
My wife and I were renting our house. At the end the lease, the landlord told us he was going to raise the rent by $250. This was during 2005 when the market was exploding. We rationalized that it would be cheaper to buy a home than to pay the extra rent.

I've been getting into Prophecy latetly. Some of the first comments I hear are asking if it changes my views of salvation. To which I reply 'no'. It is my view that what they are ultimately asking is - is this a serve topic or one I have the option to ignore?
It is interesting to note how many beleivers are willing to add on duty, but then are selective to which duties they add. As if it is a balancing act between the two.


# the banana

## Intro
Faithful in little is faithful in much. Can that also be described of wisdom? For example, how much of life can be learned from a banana. A banana goes through green, gold, and brown stages. What if that's a map of us?

## Green
When we are green, we are learning and trying to figure things out. At this stage we could say that we're not ready. In software, we use this terminology that a new person is 'green', or even 'super green'. It took me at least 4 years before I could feel I'm not green.

## gold
But soon, we mature and turn gold. This is the stage where we thrive. We are ready and excited to attack all sorts of dreams in our hearts. We are told that you can accomplish whatever you want. But thriving feels so good and natural. Our bodies, minds, and experiences are at their prime. Now is the time to strike. This gold stage of life can be long or short. People can also enter into it early or later in life.
Gold is not only a professional pursuit. There are many who seek golden value in the the christian circles by having the most to say, offer, and serve. The idea is that in the golden stage, you are in pursuit of the top. There is a ladder you see and are climbing to get as high as you can go.
It the posture of postivite thinking 'whatever the mind can concieve you can achieve' really what we learn from Christ? I'm beginning to see that as a form of white witch craft as we chant spells over ourselves in a quest to elevate our posture to a better place.

## Brown
But sooner or later, you will begin to see brown spots on your golden body. Indicators that your time in your prime is limited. This scares a lot of people. Some cover their brown spots with gold paint to maintain the outward perception that they are still thriving. For they have defined their identity with the things they can accomplish inside their gold stage of life. How can I continue to excel if my body loses it's ability to perform? But brown is an inevitable place you will enter. This is where you stop and see that your a falable, weak, and temporal being.


## conclusion
However, green, gold, and brown is not just a description of age or ability. See the big picture that none of these are permanent will detach you from all three. I am neither thriving forever, nor am I dying forever.
Entering brown will show you how fleeting the pursuits of gold are. They cannoot be attained and in fact will create significant pain if you rest your identity on who you are and what you do in your stage of glory.
Entering brown at 37 is different than entering it at 67. What I see is I am still alive and well but my interests ahve changed. I am doing all I can to remove the alure of the gold and be available for God.
The brown stage of life is Going through what I have with olivia has moved me out of the yellow and into the brown stage of life much sooner. I've entered into the brown stage in a unique way. Sooner than I expected but also in an unexected way. I actually accepted it in a way that made it something I wasn't resisting. I think that's what major events do. They have the ability to make all the unimportant things you thought were important loose their grip on your mind.
Entering brown at 37 means I still have a lot of life left. I am not weary or tired, but I've left and continuing to encourage the departure of building my own kingdom. It has also shown me that life is not about a stage nor accumulation nor accomplishment. Life is the process we are going through to be formed into the likeness of Christ in a variety of environments.




# two power sources
God has given you a power source the equivalent of a battery.
His power soucre is that of an electrical outlet. He will fund his plans.


# Debts are not burdensome
I've taken on more debt again, nearly $100,000 with school loans, medical bills, and credit cards for living. I put it on a spreadsheet and see that I won't be done repaying for another 12 - 15 years if I go at the rate I'm going.
in the past this would create tremendous anxiety because it was in the opposite direction of where I wanted to be. That is, a man full of equity. But as I see this world not my kingdom, I've removed the definition that debt is a bad thing.
My God will supply all our needs and this is a factual promise


# Rejecting the pyramid scheme
Olivia passed away a year ago today. It's a strange experience to stand on the soil of the cemetery where you've buried a child. Life after p a death has taken me down some interesting thoughts about…everything. It has a way of removing the perception of infinite life on this side of eternity.

I used to live like I would live forever. Why not? I had strength and desire. But as those begin to run out I'm ready to receive a p different message. When my presumption of infinite life died, so did other views that were based on it. It's most clear to me when I p compare what I believed at 27, 17, and 7 to 37. Each previous decade held a simpler and safer view of life. Almost sheltered. But I'm beginning to notice a common theme between my life's seemingly random events: A call to reject the kingdoms that war against God's kingdom.

Recently I watched a clip that suggested the Illuminati created the monetary system. 'Illuminati', as in the group of people controlled by p the devil for the devil’s long term plan described in Revelation: One-world religion, One-world government, the anti-christ, 666, and other p prophesies Christians typically believe in. Topics that I would generally agree with but never had interest or time to explore logistics. Up until this year those were fringe topics I had zero interest in.

But regardless of the inspiration, ever since I heard that the money system is not of God I have begun thinking through what it would mean p to reject my acceptance of the entire establishment that rules our life and thoughts. Can I live with it the same way I live with gay marriage and abortion? As in, part of this world but not choices I agree with.

I live like I need money to survive. But is that true? If money is a world system, then I’m going to pray about what it means to refrain p from serving it. I’m not talking about racking up credit card debt and stopping paying rent. But living in the truth that God meets all my p needs. It sounds like a BIG, crazy idea to talk about rejecting material systems that make me feel comfortable. It’s a big paradigm shift but it’s also amazing how much more of God I seeing when I remove my kingdom and the world's kingdoms from my focus.

No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Matthew 6:24

I like all of this. Good and interesting things to think about, if I can ever make time from trying to make it in the world.

Brother, Steve
Yes, Steve. I was the same. But all living things have the same cycle: born, thrive, die. I recognize I've entered the death stage sooner than most of my friends. One day you will enter into the dying stage and you will see how hollow it is at the top of the pyramid.

But I agree the world holds many comforts. To the point I gladly pursue them rather than leaning on God. But death shows how temporal the temporary things are. I want to remove the world’s systems from my definition of ‘the good life’.




# wild west
We were in Colorado for two months before I got a call from a long-time friend in the t-shirt business. I was now a contractor for my day job. Jeremy wanted to start a business. At that point I was convinced I was getting out of the t-shirt industry. I had already spent nearly 15 years in and around t-shirts and concluded it was not the way I was going to make money. I was in Denver to go to grad school and become a real estate developer.

After a few discussions I changed my mind and decided that we could try to make it a go but we needed to hit $500k in sales or we should shut down. I was tired of 'playing business'. That was 6 months before grad school started so I had time to devote to working on the company.

While in school, I had mentioned to a professor that I owned my own company. He connected me to another apparel company who needed an art director. THey had bought ouray out of bankruptcy and were rebuilding it. My only condition was that I would still be allowed to run AMB3R on the side. I joined them and took the following semester off grad school to focus on my day job and side business. I also told them that I am pursuing Harvard and will leave _when_ i get accepted. My big thinking was probably due to how much hot air was in my head.

For nearly 3 years, my schedule was working a 40 hour day job as art diretor. Attending night classes two nights a week. spending another 10 - 15 hours a week on amb3r. Studying for the GMAT, and working on essays for Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, and Kellogg.

The routine was preparing us for our future and providing some income to pay down credit card debt from the previous season.

In 2010 Danae's brother Jake was shot and killed. This set us into another tail spin. I pressed on thinking that was the right thing to do.



# thinking big
I think of myself as a boat without a rudder. I was seeking to know what.

I was seeking the question 'what am I supposed to do' from 17. I did not have a clear understanding of how I was supposed to be. During my 20's I read broad in a search for answers. I read a lot of self help books. Titles like 'think and grow rich', 'magic of thinking big', 'see you at the top', 'glen bland method', 'how i raisd myself from failure to success in selling'. All in all, probably 20 titles on the topic.

It seems like I was thinking about the wrong things. That I should be thinking big. When my first t-shirt company had fallen apart, I figured I had the right stuff but it was just channeled in the wrong area.

I concluded that my problem was I hadn't had the right education. So, I concceeded defeat and started my search for business school. I was going to make up for lost time by attending real estate school adn get an MBA while I was there.

My failures and wandering were not going to hold me back.

During this time, the real estate markets were booming so I thought maybe I should get into real estate since t-shirts weren’t working out. I looked into real estate programs and ultimately found one in Denver. I had loved Colorado for 10 years and when the thought of using grad school as the responsible reason to move West, I moved forward with it. I was accepted to DU as a dual-degree program of real estate development and MBA.

Before I had begun classes, Danae and I were at the library and she randomly found a book on the shelf that described nearly the exact vision of what I had thought I was going to school for. So, I picked it up and read [new harvest]() excited to get some prep. What shocked me was that I had realized that industry was not for me in the slightest.

I called my admissions counselor and explained the situation. He said that I could switch no problem and that the way the dual degree worked, I could delay any other decisions about the MBA stuff. I ended up switching out of the Real Estate and enrolled in the Masters of Finance program.

I was 31 years old when I enrolled in the program. I was on the older side. The kids I was around made me think that I had not yet found my audience. After talking with Danae, I started to think that an MBA is only worth something if it’s from a top 5 school. So, I ended up unenrolling from the MBA side and just focused on the Finance.

By this time I was convinced that my past woes were due to my short sighted thinking. that the world was really mine and anyone's for the taking.

I was only in school for one semester when I took a class trip to New York. The real reason I took that course was it would enable me to take a road trip to visit top 10 MBA schools. I drove and visited the campuses of Harvard, Wharton, Darden, University of Michigan, University of Chicago, Kellogg. My dad flew out and visited 3 or so with me.

Taking that tour at 31 was something I wish I did at 17. To see and experience what was possible. I was so excited about the possiblities of getting my life back on track.


# the bubble
I had no plans to attend college. But during the Summer I had graduated highschool I received a mass mailer from Libery University. It had offered $16,000 off college. "A college sending me something? This is odd." So I approached my parents who were shocked I would consider a christian college. Truth be told, Had that been a culinary school, I would have been making eggs benedict for 4 years. In the following month I had applied, been accepted, and had 3 weeks to prepare for going to college.

My experience was a 4 year Summer Camp. Tucked in the Blue Ridge mountains, there was always something to do there. I met my wife and other really incredible people.

I felt dirty from my high school decisions so I was excited to be surrounded by some rules and direction. I welcomed following those things. It was something I don't feel I had before so It was a nice change.

I had to wear a tie to class everyday. On top of that, church was just short of a forced event. Since I wore a tie to class, the last thing I wanted to do was dress up for sunday's. That oppression was the ingredients to start a t-shirt company called 'church clothes'. I did it as a creative outlet. Around campus I developed a reputation for making t-shirts so a few bands approached me about making shirts for them. I thought it a fun idea.

Looking back on that time, I think of starting a t-shirt company, organizing food eating contests, being a camp counselor, taking a year off to live in Utah, helping manage a skate team, taking a cross-country road trip, back packing eurpose and having fun.

I spent two Summers working construction and I hated it. The job started so early I would look out the window hoping the darkness was due to rain clouds to prevent me from having to go. Feels like there should have been a converstaion during those accumulated 2 summers of hated work that my dad would have inquired about his son and asked what he would want to do for a vocation.

I ended up taking a year off college. The first part was to spend 6 months in Utah. During that summer I worked landscaping. One day I was changing a blade on a mower and the wrench slipped. I got 13 stitched but also nearly could have lost my thumb.  Again, I came to the realization that I didn't want to do landscaping for my life - so I went back to school with a new resolve to get good grades and learn something while there.

I never really had any direct conversation that my life and times at college should be preparing me for something. That I should be there to earn some skills or think about my future. I was immersed in a bubble and did whatever I wanted.

The word 'career' was mysterious and uncertain for me. As I see it now, it makes a lot of sense why children follow in their father's trade. He is supposed to model something that they get good enough to make an income doing. I didn't have that. I had the opposite. I remember a few distinct times when my father would volunteer. "Son, my father didn't instruct me in my career and I don't know how to instruct you in yours." The amount of disappointment, uncertainty, and concern that produced made me scramble.

The simple basics of understanding how one's wired, then exploring hobbies to foster that feels like a simple activity that my father should have done in a direct opposition to the hurts his father gave him by not doing the same. I seem to only have that perspective after raising my two young boys. I don't see how my relationship with my father would excuse my behavior with my sons.

When I start going back to my childhood to think about my own memories and relationship with my parents when I was a child, that is the first thing that comes up. “Your father and Grampa were always fighting”

That answer was sufficient for a while.

I don’t know what they were doing but it wasn’t raising me. My sister had once said it that they were ‘for us, they just weren’t with us.’

Throughout the time, I began to gravitate to the description of 'entrepreneur'.

The first Summer after I graduated liberty I went to Flordia to be a camp director for a small summer camp. It was affilicatd with the skate team I helepd managed. It turned out to be such a confusing time that as soon as it was done, I regrouped in Lynchburg.


# Basement
I completed the course in June and drove from Chicago to Michigan to meet up with Danae and the boys. I had not seen them in 3 months.

In michigan I was listening to a series by Mike Wells. He talked about how the spirit is inside the Soul. I didn't understand that and was at such a low point I had nothing to think about but that concept. So I started asking God what is the Spirit and where is it.

Over the course of a few nights I began to have dreams that answered some of those questions.

I dreampt I was by a house. The house looked like it was built in the 1920's I walked in and there was a tree in there. the tree had fruit and i noticed that the fruit were 3 different kinds of fruit. Those fruits were the fruit of thinking, feeling, and doing. They were the fruit of my soul. My soul was a place that housed my mind, will and emotions. At that point I was also able to realize that the 'house' was my body.

In the dream I realized there was a basement too. I went down and found a campfire down there. At that moement i was talking with God and he said - we have come into your spirit. I said 'great what do I do here?' he said "nothing" you just sit and stare at that campfire. Okay, I've done that before and I like that feeling. I will rest here.

The next night I had a dream about the house. I walked in the front door and saw the tree. I went over to it but this time the light showed me that the fruit I was about to eat was rotten. No part of it was appelaing so I didn't want to eat it. I went back down to the basement and noticed the tree's roots were coming throught the roof. The roots could be nourished by the fire below.

At that moment I realized that the activities of think, feel, and do can be controlled by me or nourished and activitated by the fire. Okay, so my soul will not atrophy if I don't do it. I'll just sit by this fire again.

The next night I returned and noticed that the fire was not a fire. It was the reflection on the side of a tunnel. I decided to jump into the tunnel. Since it was a dream i was able to see myself in both first and third person. I saw myself sliding down a long tunnel but then I also saw myself reaching the center of a force that looked like a sun. My 3rd person view of myself was so small that I was nearly a spot. But yet still the sun in my dream was so big I couldn't see around it. It was a power dwelling insid me that was not of me. The campfire was a reflection of an inner, deeper power.

It occured to me that a living power could influence my soul's activities if I choose to live from the basement instead of the first floor. My choice was to either being my day by engaging with soul's thinking, feeling, or doing. Or beginning with a surrender to another enttitity who would inspire those things.

The different in starting with the spirit is that when exciting thoughts, feelings, or actions take place from me, I have a front row seat to know they are not of my own doing. I have a relationship with God who is doing things in and through me.

I begain to recognize the spirits voice

# stop
once i started to realize that i was not going to get fired from Living Social I had some mental margin. The first thing that came to me wsa that my daughter had died. but then, i attached that to a larger trend. I had not had a chance to process all that had gone on in the years leading up to that.

I'm a programmer in Boulder. What in teh world. We were living in Denver with a vision to an MBA. But I lost my goal, my company, my brother in law, my house, i was unemployed for 9 months, and lost my daughter. What was all this happeneing.

it was at this time the Lord started to reframe my story. The story of my parents and and my career was a perfect situation to create a soil for me to begin to craft my inner identity for temporary gains. I started to realize that my motivations were deeper than just providing and making ends meet. I was not interested in a car, I was interested in a BMW. I was not interested in living in Boulder, I wanted to live in a bigger house that I owned.

I started to realize that I wanted things in a way to provide more than the necessary things. I started to see how much of my drive was to have such accomplishments that other people would see, admire, respect, honor, and worship me. I saw how all this striving was a way for me to be King.

Just as Olivia was being formed in Danae's womb, so we are being formed for our Second birth.  These adventures of highs and lows helped me see that I have a heart issue that needs to be addressed.



# Royal blood
People do not defend what they do not own. But why do I fight to keep honor, prise, respect, and followers? Those are attributes of royalty. What if we are actually royalty. But not in the way we origionally think.
I think my quest for purpose and significance is an internal one that was not unresolved by my parents. But the very reason I was brought to this Earth.
I needed to see who I am and who God is in order to be prepeared for my position in eternity. Just as a baby is not ready for this world at 5months along in a pregnancy, we are not ready for eternity until we spend time recognizing who we are in light of God.



# peter pan years

I have often referred to my first 12 years of life as the Peter Pan years. We lived in Orlando, Florida in a neighborhood that was well insulated from traffic. So, we had free range of the streets, bushes, and surrounding woods.

We would play baseball and war around the block and all kinds of games. There were probably 50 other kids in the neighborhood that were around my age. It was not uncommon to bike over to David Franz’s house to plan nintendo. Play Legos with Kevin Lear. Play some G-rated version of Dungeons and Dragons at Steve Taylor’s house. Read Comic books at Tom O’briens. Play GI Joe’s At Armands House. Play baseball with the Mammon kids. Smoke cigarettes with with David Heart. And all sorts of other types of activities.

I also watched my share of tv. I probably watched every episode of Bewitched, f-troop, Gomer Pile, Andy Griffith, 321-contact, reading rainbow, price is right, and more. Then, when I was tired of those, I could always play some nintendo.

I spent so much time playing and could do whatever I wanted. Everything was within biking distance. The super market. The hobby store. The library. The baseball field. The YMCA. We would ride bikes to spring lake and spend hours there. Just me and a friend, cousin, brother, or combination of them all.

Calling them Peter Pan years was a tribute to the fun and freedom I had a child. But lately, I've relized they portray another part accurately. I have little to no memeories of my parents involvement in my life. Yes, I have memories of them in the peripheral. But, there was limited direct interaction with me.

My did give my brothers and myself one proactive talk. The 'Your mother and I stayed virgins before we were married and I admonish you to do the same'. Talks with Steve and Mike confirm that the conversation with Dad highly influenced all three of us to keep our virginity for marriage. Even if it was only in the most technical sense.

But, other than that any ongoing conversations with my father or mother about career, finances, college, education, growth, direction, purpose, talents, interests, being a gentleman, how to treat a woman, or living a life on purpose were not apart of my relationship with either of my parents.

I was a lost boy.

p
i  Is the next part necessary?

When I think back on that I have a few thoughts. First, I boast about how times were different and that we were safe to do those kinds of things. I can agree to that. But, I can also say that by the time I was in 5th grade, I was staying the night at the Bishop’s house who were probably 8 home schooled kids. During the sleep over, the kid my age asked me if I wanted to see something  and he opened a bottom dresser drawer and showed me his older brothers copy of playboy. I had never seen anything like that. It didn’t catch me at first because the the angle of the magazine was more in his favor. I never really thought to tell my parents about it. Then, I remember being allowed to spend the night with the Shelton’s when I was in 6th grade. If my memory serves me correctly, Eric’s father was an ex convict who was somehow allowed to have custody of his 3 kids. My parents didn’t seem to mind to let me spend the night with them. He didn’t seem to mind us watching R rated movies. They had HBO and whatever else and we would just stay up all through the night as unsupervised 6th graders and watch whatever came on.



# no man's land

I had a picture of life with Danae and providing nice things and doing so from a title that garnered respect and admiration for me. That, I had arrived and you can follow my lead.

I had taken the GMAT 3 times. I had written 20 essays with hours of revisions and 4am mornings to do so. I had sought to juggle this.  I applied to all four schools the third round. This is not ideal but for time and such I couldn't make the 2nd round cut. It was about 2 weeks before I received a response. It was from Wharton and they said no. Then, I receive my letter from harvard and they said no. Stanford. No. Kellogg - Waitlisted. Phew, I dodged that bullet. I guess it looks like I'm going to Kellogg.

Over the next few months I decided to reapply to Harvard and Kellogg. I figured that Harvard turned me down because I was in the third round. And that kellogg I was 'in' because I was waitlisted. By this time, I was already finished with Ouray and was working full tiem with AMB3R.

December, 2011 I receive letters from Harvard No, but also Kellogg had said no again. I was so convinced that I was going to be accepted to grad school that I had already helped find my replacement at my day job. I had set a date and was moving forward.

Okay. Let's just freeze everything and just stabalize and figure out what's going on. All of the sudden AMB3R got more valuable in my eyes. It was all I had left.

Nearly that same week the landlord called us to let us know they had sold the house and we had about a month to be out. Okay.

The day I received the letter from Kellogg, I was to have lunch with a guy who was offering to help new coders learn to code. I had been dabbling around and needed some guidance so I reached out to him. I was in shell shock and told him how I just heard the news. He was working at livingSocial at the time and told me about a  coding internship at LivingSocial, called Hungry Academy.

I applied and while we were waiting, we just started packing the house. we didn't know where we were packing to. During that week, LivingSocial emailed me that they wanted me to fly out to interview. We didn't have time and didn't want to get a new apartment if they were goign to hire me. So, we decided to put our stuff in storage for 2 weeks while we wait if we're going to move to DC, or stick around in Denver.

I also hadn't given up on the idea of attending Kellogg's part time MBA program. Maybe I would opt for that.

We moved out of our apartment, and were staying in a La Qunita in Denver while I flew to DC to be interviewed. I flew back and we stayed at some friends house for a few more days waiting to hear back on the news.

We didn't have any news and all our stuff was in storage. So we decided to just start driving East. We did not know where we were driving. We wondered if it would be Chicago, or DC. We drove until we reached topeka kansas when we had the idea to call my parents and ask if we could stay with them until we heard back. Of course they said we could. So, we charted course for Georgia. En route, the car engine blew up and we had to stay in a road side motel for 3 days but that's beside the point.

What we thought would be a two week word turned into 8 months of homelessness.

That homeless was trying to answer the same question 'what am I supposed to do?'. I had conceeded that an MBA program was my way of redoing and reconnecting but if I couldn't have that, then how am I supposed to get on the right track.

I heard back from Hungry Academy and they said no. I applied to a consulting job that i was told i would be 'perfect for' in Atlata. Their clients were in apparel. OH that's me for sure! I did not make it to the second interview.

There was a new code school in Chicago called 'starter leauge' that I applied to. I was accepted it was a 3 month program. Danae agreed and she went and lived with her parents for 3 months with the boys while i went to chicago.

I left starter league without any job prospects. Jeremy and I had begun to have a falling out. I wanted to either buy or sell AMB3R from him. I told him that in March but it wasn't until July of that Year we closed. I practially gave him the company. I was clueless on where to go. So, we went to Michigan and spent the summer at the lake house.






# Grampa
Grampa was in the insurance business. He worked for MetLife and was good at what he did. As top sales agent over 30,000 sales agents the company moved him and his family to London to start a branch for the company out there. Grampa was able to retire around his 40th birthday. He got saved and became an evangelist like you wouldn’t believe. I still have his script down 20 years later.

“Tell me Tom, if A bomb were to drop here in the next 5 minutes and we were all killed, do you know where you’d spend eternity? If I could tell you, would you like to know?” I couldn’t have a friend in the same room for more than 5 minutes without Grampa asking my friend that question. It got to be so embarrassing and predictable, I wouldn’t bring friends over if my grandparents were over.

Years later, I came to understand that he was an alcoholic and the corporate life he lived must have been pretty scandalous. When my grandfather got saved, he decided that business not going to be something he was going to teach his son. When I first heard about this, I suppose I thought it noble that he would only look on eternal things.

My grandfather had a lot of fringe issues that he talked about to anyone any everyone. They were things like using only the KJV bible. Or the purpose of water baptism. Paul was the apostle to the gentiles. They were things that at some point or another each of my siblings and cousins would pay him enough attention because we loved him and wanted to know for ourselves if he was crazy. I suppose there is about 20% of what he said that I take away as being relevant.

All in all we had a friendly and gentle relationship from my view. If I put up with his script about Paul and other dogmatic views, I would be rewarded with a handshake containing a 'secret' $20 bill.



# getting perspective
I never stopped to think about where all these thought originally came from. Where did I innately desire purpose, clarity, and understanding. At the time, I assumed it was because I was meeting immediate needs of food, shelter, adn clothing.

But now I see that those were just part of the journey to soften my heart and prepare me for what was really going to happen. That I needed to have experiences that moved me from luke worm, to complete confidence in myself so that when my self natually feel - I would lose confidence in myself.


# finding a wife
I remember the moment I first laid eyes on Danae in the common area. She was alive and full of smiles. I was a senior at the time and had deduced from my parents story that college is where you find a wife. So, as I started looking for my wife, I found Danae.

We were friends for a semester and I looked for her wherever I could. Then, my grandfather funded a 2 month Eurpose back pack trip for me my brothers, and my cousin Jon. During that time, Danae and I emailed getting to know one another. Some of My highlights on teh trip were finding an internet cafe and seeing new mail from her.

I returned to Liberty that Fall and we started dating shortly after. I graduated that December, and she decided not to return to class. Since she was moving back to Florida, I felt the chance to work down in Flordia, 2 hours awy from her would be a nice way to continue our relationshiop.

ALl in all, it was a good time getting to know one another. And I had made up in my midn I was gong to marry her but I just hadn't proposed yet. SO, 6 months later, I approached her parents and asked if they'd give her permission to move back to Virgina so that we could be close to each other while we we were dating.

I came back to Lynchburg with a determination to solve my career puzzle so that I could take Danae as my wife. T-shirts were fun but not making me any income. I was working at a restaurant. So, I thought maybe I'll do the grandfamily business and go into insurance. I loved Danae and just wanted to provide for her.

So I went through the hoops to study for the life insurance exam and go through all itnerviews. I think I spoke with 4 different insurance companies; new york life, mass mutual, north western mutual, met life. I was in a position to work for any of them.

During this time, danae misread my intense desire to study as being aloof. She didn't realize that at 18, I was clueless and now the pressure of providing was right on top of me. I had to solve something immediately as I saw it.

I mishandled our relationship and understandably guys around her work were taking notice of her.That threw me for a loop and in the course of about 3 months of this, we ended up breaking up.

At my last interview, right before accepting an offer with north western mutual, I pulled back. I felt like I was doing that for her and if she wasn't in my life, then why subject myself to a career I wasn't into.

So, I went back to what I liked doing which was making t-shirts. I did that for about another month designing, printing, and selling shirts at a few local conferences. During that time I got contacted by a friend to go out and sell merchandise for the music bands. I was only waiting tables and the idea of going on tour was awesome.

So, I packed all my stuff up in VA, moved it to a storage unit in GA where my parents lived and set out to go on tour.

I was really distraught about Danae and myself. In total, we were not talking for about 6 weeks. At the time Pete Yorn's [music for the morning after] was out. I was listening to that album constantly. For whatever reason, that music made me think of my life without Danae. I didn't like that.

We were apart for 6 weeks before returning and I realized that the limbo was not a good place to be. So, I drove to FL and proposed to her. It blew her away that we were apart and then I was proposing. That was Spring of 2001.

It would be nearly 3 years before we were married. Once I had her as mine, I again started looking for ways to provide.

We both worked toward living in the same town again. My parents and her family were living in Ga so we decided to move there. It took us 9 months to realize that was not our home.

Although I was in pursuit of a career, I knew that marriage was more important. Since we could go anywhere, So, I thought what would be an amazing way to start our life with an 'extended honeymoon'. So, we moved to Del Mar and lived on the beach for that first year.

The majority of our time was long walks on the beach, eating thai food, and laying low.

I painted houses, did freelance graphic work, and t-shirts.



# dazed and confused
In the Summer between 9th & 10th grade my parents decided to move us to Northern Virginia. Dad had a bible school friend he was going to work with. I remember mom and dad sitting us down and selling us on all the 'pros' of going. The failed to provide the 'cons' list of leaving a place we loved. I hadn't put much thought into it because I didn't realize the finality of moving.

Life in Orlando was fun, sun, and friends.  To put into perspective.  my Florida high school was across the street from Universal Studios. The 4,000 student school was immaculate and perfect. Some of the members from N'SYNC and backstreet boys were in my classes. The highschool baseball team was AAA and players like [Johnny Dammon]  went to school there.

That was my definition of normal.

The high school I attended in Virgina was built in a cornfield, in 1964. The years growing up in Northern Virginia were so confusing for me. My Orlando childhood was replaced by cornfields and steve miller band.

I was told the youth group would be my new circle. Great, a built in social network. I looked forward to everyone loving me as much as I was loving them. Turns out that wasn't the case. The circles were already tightly formed and I was on the outer wall. The one silver lining is that's where I met Josh Woodyard. He became me guide into art, music, and general youthful mischief.

Cornfield high was a AA baseball team. While I didn't even make second day of tryouts in Florida, I incredibly made the team in Virgina. That was an unexpected victory. I confess I didn't take it as serious as the other guys on the team. They played their hearts out like we were one level removed from the majors. Call it the contrast or some internal apathay I don't know but I didn't exert the kind of energy they did. So, those guys didn't become my 'circle'.

Since Youth Group or sports didn't take for me, I ended up in the party crowd. There it was what I was familiar with. Unproductive fun. But this time we had weed and liquor. It feels like aroudn this time I can look back on two active emotions. I was completely depressed that I no longer lived in Florida. And, I had a strong desire to make a name for myself.

The party crowd has a low bar for success. You just need to contribute something to the crew that makes the time more fun. It can be a car, the weed, the party spot, or humor. I think I wanted to offer all those things. I found myself doing what I could like normal to out do the crew.

I got into trouble and did so because it seemed to help me test the boundaries. I wasn't sure what I could get away with and I had come to the consclusion that my inner limit was imaginiative. So, I started pushing the boundaries. I ended up getting into trouble with the law that at 17, I had almost enough to be sent to Juvinile detention until I was 21.

Looking back on those years, it seems that the only times my parents and I had conversation would be either about logistics, or repremanding me for my bad behavior. I don't recall any attempts to provide a platform for me to walk onto that would get me out of that tailspin.

I barely graduated highschool. My "Where they'll be in 10 years " was "In Jail."

Olivia's due date was supposed to be today. However, that is not the case.
Transcript from Olivia's Funeral
(Song to be played while reading...)
I like to think that this song portrays Olivia's first 100 steps in heaven. Hearing birds for the first time. Walking for the first time in a garden as morning fog begins to dissipate. I can't wait to take that walk myself... Meeting and experiencing all this love and support and attention is beyond words. I am going to speak candidly about what we experienced. He prepared us for this path. He taught us to recognize his voice over the past 2 years. We learned the difference between the soul and the spirit. How the soul is all our activity - thinking, feeling, and doing. But the spirit is a temple to meet with God. My general observation of people who are walking alongside us are trying to imagine what it would be like for us. Those imaginations are soul related activity - wondering how we're feeling, thinking, or doing. We are not living from the soul. If we were then we would be a wreck, too. Just as the lungs weren't made for water, our souls can't handle darkness. Feelings, thoughts, and will are are undone here. In your spirit, you realize you are not alone. There we meet with the Lord. The Holy Spirit can handle this and gladly becomes our eyes, ears, and guide. The Spirit sounds like is your voice so it's odd because you are in a posture of listening and it takes some time getting used to it. Usually the first thing you'll hear is "I love you."Our innate desires for comfort and safety avoid darkness. But He encouraged me by saying that In the darkest places are hidden the most precious of treasures. He again encouraged me by framing the temporal nature of what we're going through. That just because I can look at the sun during a sunset doesn't mean that the sun is tame. And that though these days seem dark, doesn't mean they are. We are living moment by moment and find the peace and strength when we remain with him. I just want to remind you that all things work together for good and this is no exception. Thank you again for all your love and support.


# It's not what it looks like

## Just because these surroundings appear dark, doesn't mean they are.
God spoke to me and put this into perspective. He said just because I can look at the sun during a sunset doesn't mean the sun is tame. And just because these surroundings appear dark, doesn't mean they are. The truth is Jesus is alive and well in what looks like negative times. But soon enough, this will turn positive and we will all rejoice together.

# The dark room

## Hidden in the negative is the positive we long for
The doctors have yet to provide additional information. They came in yesterday to reiterate how they see Olivia not surviving, or best living in near vegetable state. Over coffee I shared some of what I was thinking with Sarah and she told me to post it.
Mike Wells tells a story of the time he went to receive his wedding pictures. His photographer told him that, to develop the photos, they needed to enter a dark room. Wells then intertwines the story with life. He said the name of the dark room is 'Faith'. The first image he saw in there was negative. When he saw it, he wanted to throw it away. The photographer said 'hidden in the negative is the positive we long for'.
Before Wells could keep the positive image the photographer said there is one more step. You need to dip the positive in a vat of acid to 'set' it. Mike wondered where the acid comes from, to which the photographer replied 'it will come'.
As I heard that story, I was disappointed to think that there's another trial looming before receiving the positive completely. The pre-acid positive for me was discovering how to hear the Holy Spirit's voice. (I wrote about it as three parts of you) Olivia has set and sealed those truths in me. So, good news is it doesn't take very much acid to set a positive. :-)
The positives that are birthed from a negative experience are with you the rest of your life so that you get to bring what you learned with you into the next trial.
We are entering the dark room again and we are staring at a negative. But this time we're doing it having seen how the Lord transforms negatives. It's as if faith is not even the right word for how we're encountering all this. It feels kind of like watching a favorite movie the second time and picking up details missed the first time. The Lord is alive and well and shows himself to those who seek him.

# In the hour after.

## After Olivia passed away, Danae told the nurse what she was thinking.
After Olivia passed away a nurse came in. Danae cannot stop herself from engaging, so she told the nurse what she was thinking.
Danae said that dogs require a 2 month gestation because they only live 15 - 20 years.
Whereas humans require 9 months because we generally live 70 - 80 years.
Danae then took what seemed like a peculiar turn and said that when God made angels He put His glory on them. Unfortunately, some of the angels couldn't hold His glory without envy and attempted to take it as their own. Consequently, those angels who thought they could be God were cast out of heaven.
Danae then said how when God made man, He made us in His image.
Danae continued that if we are to live for eternity, then we probably need a gestation period of 70 - 80 years to prepare us for it.
She concluded by saying that the sweetest thing about Olivia was that her heart was pure enough to only need two weeks on earth to hold God's glory safely for all eternity.
p.author "I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us."


# Mature faith

## See God in every situation
Remember, we are daily crucified with Christ. The one who is crucified has no rights. Agreeing with this reality means we deny our vain attempts and accept His eternal will. For in acceptance, we confess with our lives that Jesus reigns supreme, even if we don't agree, or like it.
If the Lord's will for our life is waste, wonder, pain, or poverty then we say (in faith) that we want this too. For if it is happening, then it is Your permitted will, Oh Lord, and we know You are working it all for good.
Through these eyes of humility and faith we see God in every situation.
p.date And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28
p.date Now if we are children, then we are heirs — heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. - Romans 8:17&18


# The three parts of you

## The difference between the soul and spirit
God created us with three parts; body, soul, and spirit.
The soul is made of the mind, will, and emotions. These three produce the activities of "think", "do", and "feel". It's pretty easy to tell when someone is caught up in one of these activities. But trying to be the warm, intellectual, activist is a hard balancing act. Personally, my track record of activities birthed in the soul is abysmal and have begun to lose confidence in my ability to maintain at the levels I want.
Inside of our soul is the spirit. The spirit is not thinking, feeling, or doing. It is an internal domain that influences what our mind, will, and emotions act upon.
You are born with a spirit you inherited from Adam. If you were to inspect that spirit, you would discover that it's an empty chair that once held something mysterious. It resembles an Egyptian pyramid that tells of something great that was lost. There is no point in returning to a graveyard. As consequence, you close the door to your spirit and live life in the activity of the soul, where you believe you are in control.
God has given us the choice to continue with the spirit you inherited or trade it in for a new one. When you ask God to exchange the Adam spirit for the Holy Spirit, God converts the emptiness of Adam's tomb into a new kingdom. There, He waits for you to visit again and discover someone dwelling inside you!
The more you return to the kingdom within, the more you begin to realize that you can remain there at all times. It's like your personal Narnia.
You do not "think", "feel", or "do" in the Spirit. There, you listen and rest. However, living in the Spirit does not mean the soul's activities atrophy. No, the soul becomes empowered! Thinking, Feeling, and Doing will occur but it will be God who inspired the soul-activity as you remain with Him. You will observe and participate in activities that are not self-generated and realize the indwelling Christ for yourself.
Conversations in the Spirit take some getting used to because the Holy Spirit actually sounds like your voice. It can be awkward because you hear what sounds like your voice, but you are in a posture of listening. The thought of handing over control requires a level of defeat, surrender, and faith. But when it comes, you realize that life is much deeper and God much more real and present than you could imagine. For in this place, control is relinquished to the One who has all the real control anyway.
