        title: "Craft CMS for Rails Developers"
        body: "Chat with <a href='http://www.twitter.com/iamlacroix' target='_blank'>Michael Lacroix</a> About Craft CMS<br>
          <p>I'm not a fan of PHP either...but these guys know their stuff...don't group it with shit like WordPress. It's built on a Rails-like framework. It's 'plugins' are all organized into model, controller, services, etc. that take advantage established API's within the CMS. But it's content architecture capabilities/flexibility is amazing.</p><br>
          <p>They have a free version which allows for one channel content-type (blog or similar feed), plus 5 pages.</p><br>
          <p>I've tried to avoid anything PHP-related for sooo long...but this one was way too good to ignore. </p><br>
          <p>You don't need to write any PHP either, except for your initial config...but it's super simple & is just an array you edit with database info, etc. So, no PHP really All the template files are Twig (think Ruby Liquid)</p><br>
          <p>I'm also using Forge to manage any PHP/Craft servers for clients – https://forge.laravel.com/</p><br>
          <p>You could always use Heroku though too. ...but not Heroku with the free version (the $299 version includes the Amazon S3 upload feature) Anyway, with Forge you can have it manage your Digital Ocean server(s). But for something like clov3r, you could just create 1 server and have it manage a multitude of sites for you. Then just git push to your GitHub repo and it deploys. I have it track a 'production' branch so that it only deploys when I push it to that one, as oposed to 'master'</p><br>"

        body: "
        <img src='/images/notes/test_cost.png'>
        <p>Testing software is not an optional aspect to writing software. Your software will be tested (read 'used') by you, your boss, and your customers. Your task is to ensure that your code, used by other people, works. When a bug arises it will be your job to fix it. You can fix it now or you can fix it long after you have forgotten how you implemented the feature in the first place.</p>
        <br><h3>Proactive vs. Reactive workflows</h3>
        <img src='/images/notes/test_vs.png'>
        <p>It's not a matter of <em>if</em> you'll test, but a matter of <em>when</em>. You can either test pro-actively or reactively.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Testing first is the cheapest route</h3>
          <img src='/images/notes/test_flow.png'>
          <h5>Communication</h5>
            <p>This flow is also the best way to communicate back to stakeholders. Your tests are summaries of the work you have completed and the problems you have solved.</p>
          <h5>Feature Documentation</h5>
          <p>Take advantage of all the contextual meetings and brain juice invested into understanding this feature and let your first response be writing a failing assertion. You will receive immediate feedback of failure and progress. Tests are a great place to document the new features. You will know the feature is complete when the tests pass.</p>
          <h5>Bug Spotting</h5>
          <p>Tests flush out bugs.</p>
          <h5>Technical Debt / Legacy Code</h5>
          <p>You might have technical debt when you hear these comments;</p>
          <cite>Does anyone know what this does?</cite><br>
          <cite>Why does X break when I change Z?</cite>
          <h5>Improves Quality</h5>
          <p>Quality is improved because code has to be indicative, measurable, and tested.</p>
          <p>You might think that you can't write a test for it, but you can just use it. Well, that is a short lived does of happiness. Because either that will end up breaking or you will need to modify it in some way. You are not going to write any code more complex than you will be able to test so you should write tests at the outset.</p>
        <br><h3>Things to test</h3>
        <h5>Return values</h5>
        <p>Make sure you get what you expect.</p>
        <h5>Output</h5>
        <p>Do you get a 200? Does the page contain the information you expect?</p>
        <h5>Side Effects</h5>
        <p>Is the product available for sale once you activate it?</p>

        title: Strict mode
        body: "Quotes from Eloquent JavaScript<br><cite>JavaScript can be made a little more strict by enabling strict mode. This is done by putting the string 'use strict;' at the top of a file or a function body. Here’s an example:</cite><br>
        <code>
        function canYouSpotTheProblem() {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;'use strict';<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('Happy happy');<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        canYouSpotTheProblem();<br>
        // → ReferenceError: counter is not defined<br>
        </code>
        <cite>
        Normally, when you forget to put var in front of your variable, as with counter in the example, JavaScript quietly creates a global variable and uses that. <br><br>
        In strict mode, however, an error is reported instead. This is very helpful. It should be noted, though, that this doesn’t work when the variable in question already exists as a global variable, but only when assigning to it would have created it.<br><br>
        Another change in strict mode is that the this binding holds the value undefined in functions that are not called as methods. When making such a call outside of strict mode, this refers to the global scope object. So if you accidentally call a method or constructor incorrectly in strict mode, JavaScript will produce an error as soon as it tries to read something from this, rather than happily working with the global object, creating and reading global variables.
